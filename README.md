# Code Quiz
## Description
For our homework assignment, we were asked to create a timed code quiz. When the user hits start, they will have 60 seconds to answer 10 multiple choice questions. Every correctly answered question will earn the user a point. Every wrong answer will result in a penalty of 10 seconds removed from the count down timer.  
If they successfully answer all 10 questions, they will be asked to enter their initials for the High Score List. Their score, along with their initials, will be displayed with a list of other high scores.  
If the user unsuccessfully answers all the questions before the timer runs out, they will not be asked to enter their initials.
